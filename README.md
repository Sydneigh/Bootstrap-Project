Getting started.   These links set  up Bootstrap. Additionally. I integrated fonts from google fonts into the custom.css file.

The header section defines  the navigation bar. Container fluid is a bootstrap class ,which provides fluid full width div ,making the page fully responsive. Within the header, I included  the navbar-header class  which includes information for screen readers.

Next, I added the navigation menu button to  the nav bar which will appear on mobile devices. The data target helps connecting the div with the class .navbar-collapse. Inside the button I added icon bars. Lastly , I added a link to the Green SPA logo.

In  feature section I placed the text  over of the image. The container for the feature section has a class of feature, which is custom classes added in the custom.css file. Because the text should take up all the real estate of the mobile device I added col xs 12 (for small devices , 12 columns)  to the div class= feature-text

Finally, I placed all the content of the footer in the footer tags. The div class Row holds address  information. The br tag added line breaks.  The unordered list holds all the navigational hyperlinks. The fontawesome icons were added with the i tag.
